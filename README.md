# PILC-BSCSO
#An Efficient Binary Sand Cat Swarm Optimization for Feature Selection in High-dimensional Biomedical Data
a new version of Binary Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (called PILC-BSCSO), incorporating a pinhole-imaging-based learning strategy and crossover operator is presented for selecting the most informative features. First, the crossover operator is used to strengthen the search capability of BSCSO. Second, the pinhole-imaging learning strategy is utilized to effectively increase ex-ploration capacity while avoiding premature convergence. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with linear kernel is used to assess classification accuracy.
